Create a query that returns "FirstName LastName - TItle" as a single field value for 20 employees. For example, mine would be "Chad Galligan - CIO"

Create a query that returns 2 fields. The first should have the first letter of first name, a period, and their last name and have an alias of "Name_Abbr".
 Mine would be C. Galligan. The second field should be a calculation of the age they were when they started and have an alias of "Starting_Age". Mine would
  be 21. HINT: You can calculate the age they were when they started using their birthdate, their hire date, and a function.

Write a query using a group by statement that displays each Department number and the current number of employees for each department. HINT: Remember 
that the dept_emp table has department membership and to_date of '9999-01-01' means they are currently in the department.

Add to the query you wrote in #3 and add a having clause to only display departments with less than 15000 members.
